    <h2>ABOUT THE MOVEMENT</h2>
    <p>
      This isn’t just a brand — it’s a rebellion. Pleading Sanity is where survivors, misfits, warriors, and truth-tellers rise.
      It’s for the ones called “mad” who turned their pain into art. We stand for mental strength, street wisdom, and unapologetic hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      Founded by Shane Cooper (@mentally.inshane), this project started as a whisper in a padded room — and turned into a battle cry for the world.
      The clothing, the platform, the stories — all exist for one reason: to prove that madness is not a weakness. It’s a code. And we’re decoding it together.
